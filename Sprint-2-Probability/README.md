# Sprint 2 &ndash; Introduction to Probability


<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/seashell_2x.png" width="50%" />

## Overview

This sprint will introduce several important concepts related to probability and randomness. These concepts are the building blocks of more complex stochastic models and simulations that we'll talk about in later units.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this sprint, you will be familiar with the following concepts.

1. The probability mass function (pmf) of a discrete distribution.

2. Calculating the expected value, variance, and coefficient of variation of a discrete distribution.

3. Conditional probability and the concept of independent events.

4. Bayes' Rule and how to use it to calculate conditional probabilities.

## Deliverables

Complete the questions in `Deliverable_Questions.md`.

You can write up your answers in a document or write them by hand and then scan your pages.

## Resources

The file `Probability_Notes.pdf` contains my write-up of the key concepts for this sprint. It covers

- Sample spaces, events, and random variables
- Probability mass functions
- Expected value and variance of discrete distributions
- Bernoulli trials
- Geometric random variables
- Binomial random variables

It also contains several examples and practice questions.

For a more technical mathematical overview of probability, take a look at [these notes](https://www.math.wisc.edu/~seppalai/notes-for-courses/prob-basics.pdf) by Prof. Timo Seppäläinen of UW-Madison. You don't need these to learn the sprint material, but they provide some additional formal mathematical context and examples that may be helpful.

For an overview of conditional probability, read my notes, then [look here](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/probability-events-conditional.html) for more examples. The link illustrates the use of tree diagrams, which is a useful method for reasoning about sequential events. The same site has a [useful page on Bayes' Theorem](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/bayes-theorem.html).

If you would like to see more examples and development of the ideas in the notes, take a look at Chapter 4 of [this](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/amsbook.mac.pdf) *Introduction to Probability* text by Grinstead and Snell.

## Topics

At the end of this sprint, you should be familiar with the following concepts and examples.

- The definition of sample spaces, outcomes, and events. Be able to write the sample space and events for simple experiments using set notation.

- Definition of the probability mass function and the concept of total probability.

- Know the definition of expected value and variance and be able to calculate them for a given random variable. Be able to prove the linearity of the expected value.

- Be able to use total probability to simplify random variable calculations.

- Definitions of joint probabilities, conditional probabilities, and independence.

- Be able to reason about conditional probabilities, using the formal definition and the reduced sample space / tree diagram approach. Look at the urn problems and other examples in the linked resources.

- Understand the blood test example and related problems from the homework that use Bayes' Rule.
